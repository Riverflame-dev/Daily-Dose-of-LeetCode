/*
Approach 1: Brute force
- enumerate all subsets of coin frequencies that satisfy the constraints above, compute their sums and return the minimum among them.
-  the algorithm uses backtracking technique to generate all combinations of coin frequencies
- It makes a sum of the combinations and returns their minimum or -1âˆ’1 in case there is no acceptable combination.

Time complexity : O(S^n)
- In the worst case, complexity is exponential in the number of the coins n. 
- The reason is that every coin denomination c_i could have at most S/c_i values. 

Space complexity : O(n)
- In the worst case, the maximum depth of recursion is n. 
- Therefore we need O(n) space used by the system recursive stack.
