/*
Approach 2: Dynamic programming - Top down / Recursion
-  this problem has an optimal substructure property
- build the solution of the problem from top to bottom

Time complexity : O(Sâˆ—n)
- where S is the amount, n is denomination count. 
- In the worst case, the recursive tree of the algorithm has height of S and the algorithm solves only S subproblems because it caches precalculated solutions in a table. 
- Each subproblem is computed with n iterations, one by coin denomination. 

Space complexity : O(n)
- We use extra space for the memoization table.

*NOTE:
In the recursion tree, a lot of subproblems were calculated multiple times. For example, F(1) was calculated 13 times. Therefore we should cache the solutions to the subproblems in a table and access them in constant time when necessary.
